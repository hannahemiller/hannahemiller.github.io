## Research & Scientific Experience
**Environmental Education & Stewardship Intern** Apr.-Oct. 2016  
National Audubon Society: Constitution Marsh Sanctuary  
Assisted with habitat monitoring and restoration efforts including marsh bird surveys, invasive species removal and subsequent plant recolonization surveys, and deer exclosure-related forestry inventories. Conducted a census of butterfly species on the property through weekly surveys to examine diversity across habitat types; developed butterfly and other insect identification guides for visitors and future interns to use. Led educational programs for youth and adults focused on bird identification and the ecology of estuaries, wetlands, and forests.  

**Ecology Field Studies** Aug.-Dec. 2014  
State University of New York at New Paltz  
Learned to conduct ecological field and laboratory research to determine variation in forest tree species composition, tree age and growth rates, soil characteristics and soil biota, birds, and mammals at contrasting sites. Completed data analysis and scientific report of findings.

**Student Researcher** Nov. 2012-May 2015  
State University of New York at New Paltz  
Designed and performed experiments assessing the effects of the xenoestrogens bisphenol-A and bisphenol-S on planarian worms, analyzed resulting data, and presented findings at several local and regional conferences.
