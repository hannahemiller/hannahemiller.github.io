I am a biologist and naturalist passionate about preserving the environment. I am interested in habitat use and management (including invasive species management), particularly in conservation and anthropogenic change contexts. I most enjoy working with birds, amphibians, and lepidopterans. I am also interested in sharing the wonder of the natural world with others through science communication.

### How it all started

I grew up in a small suburban neighborhood in eastern New York, flanked by mountains to the east and a river to the west. My childhood was spent nursing injured birds, chasing insects, and catching frogs, snakes and the occasional baby snapping turtle down by the creek. My sisters and I were naturally curious and our parents enlisted our help in the garden, also teaching us to identify common birds, trees and other plants and animals.
